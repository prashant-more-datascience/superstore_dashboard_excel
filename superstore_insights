Problem Statement :-
To analyze regional and categorical sales data to uncover high-performing areas and improve strategic decisions in product category, regional focus, and customer segments.

Key Insights
1. Regional Performance
Central Region stands out as the top-performing region in terms of both sales and profit, with sales amounting to approximately 52065.61 and profit around 2231.99.
Other regions (East, West, South) are present in slicers but not represented visually, suggesting a need for deeper comparison in future iterations.

2. Category-wise Sales
The Technology category leads in sales (approx. 7584.81), followed closely by Furniture and Office Supplies.
This suggests that technology products are driving the most revenue, potentially due to higher unit prices or stronger demand.

This calls for inventory and pricing strategy review for underperforming sub-categories like bookcases.

4. Segment-wise Performance

This insight encourages marketing and promotional focus on the Consumer segment to maximize returns.
